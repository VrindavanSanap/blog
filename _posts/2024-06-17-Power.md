Unlike what most people think, similar to [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information), power is a real tangible thing. Even though some people are naturally good at understanding human nature and some are not, and even though the idea of acquiring power is considered taboo and psychopathic, understanding it is *extremely important* in order to not suffer under the bad guys who have it.

If you think everyone in the world is as moral of a person as you are, I hate to break it to you, sir, but there is no shortage of bad guys who are looking for every chance to get you. Cold-blooded psychopaths (1 in every 25 people in the world is physiologically a psychopath[1], i.e., they have no sense of conscience and won't feel bad after they have hurt someone). If you want to survive in such a crazy world, you have to have some form of power.

From the macroscale, i.e., power struggles between nation-states like Soviet Russia and the US, to the microscale power dynamics of personal relationships, power struggles between classes, working class and ruling class in Soviet Russia. Especially in the modern world where there are thousands of psyops going around trying to manipulate you, shill you into something learning and understanding the concept of power is exteremly important, it's definitely improvable with enough effort, and you can definitely learn how to acquire more of it.
