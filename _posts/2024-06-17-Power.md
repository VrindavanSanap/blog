Unlike what most people think, similar to 
[information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information), 
power is a real tangible thing,even though some people are natuarly good at 
understanding human nature and some are not,even though the idea of aquiring power is considerd tabbo and psychopathic understanding it is *Extremely Important* in order to not suffer under the bad guys who have it. Especially in the modern world where there are thousands of psyops going around every trying to manipulate you, shill you something, its definitely improvable with 
enough efforts
and you can definitely learn how to acquire more of it.

Some books that I know of in this regard:
    
- *The Prince* by Niccolò Machiavelli (Cliche but Machiaveli is definitely a genius in this regard reccomened by industry Titans like Garry Tan )
- *Discourses on Livy* by Niccolò Machiavelli
